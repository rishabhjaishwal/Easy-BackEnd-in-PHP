Step 4: Create a table in your database of name login with column name as        
            Sno             int          auto_increment primary key,
            username        varchar(200) not null,

            outertoinneraddr  varchar(200),
            modified_date     date,
       
       Note: Fileaddress table is for view all the file which was created using create command and this table is also used for deleting 
             files.
Step 6: How to create or open a file
             a) Open admin.php in your browser
             b) Write your file name with extension in input field (name of file) which You want to create or open then click on button                   create
     Example: 1) If you enter a file name "page1.php" in input field (name of file) then 
                      if file is present at the location of "admin.php" then it just open that file 
                      otherwise if file is not present then it will create a new empty file
              
              2) When you want to create file in where your index.php is placed then just used ("../") before page1.php it will create                          file outside adminpanel folder ("../page1.php" or "../page1.txt" or "../page1.css" or any other file extension)
              
              3)If you want to create a file in a specific folder then just use path as ("../folder1/page1.php" or "folder1/page1.php")
