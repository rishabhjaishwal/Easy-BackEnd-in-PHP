# Easy-BackEnd-in-PHP
BackEnd for content creation and editing and deleting files of website without visiting to hosting BackEnd Panel(Using own website Admin Panel)<br><br>
Step 1: Place all the file as it is in htdoc or www folder <br>
Step 2: Create a new database of any name<br>
Step 3: Find all connect.php and connect with your database name , password and username.<br>
Step 4: Create a table in your database of name login with column name as    <br>    
            Sno             int          auto_increment  primary key,<br>
            username        varchar(200) not null,<br>
            name            varchar(200) not null,<br>
            password        varchar(200) not null,<br>
            creation_date   date,<br>
            modified_date   date,<br>
            email           varchar(200),<br>
            phonenumber     int,<br>      
   <br><br>    
   Note: Login table is for login as admin temporarily into BackPanel afterwards you can change accordingly(add one login detail                     before login)<br><br>
 
 Step 5: Create another table in your database of name fileaddress with column name as <br>
            Sno               int           auto_increment primary key,<br>
            filename          varchar(200)  not null,<br>
            samefoldaddr      varchar(200),<br>
            parentfolderaddr  varchar(200),<br>
            outertoinneraddr  varchar(200),<br>
            modified_date     date,<br>
       <br><br><br>
       Note: Fileaddress table is for view all the file which was created using create command and this table is also used for deleting 
             files.<br><br>
Step 6: How to create or open a file<br>
             a) Open admin.php in your browser<br>
             b) Write your file name with extension in input field (name of file) which You want to create or open then click on button                   create<br><br><br>
     Example: 1) If you enter a file name "page1.php" in input field (name of file) then<br> 
                      if file is present at the location of "admin.php" then it just open that file<br> 
                      otherwise if file is not present then it will create a new empty file<br><br>
              2) When you want to create file in where your index.php is placed then just used ("../") before page1.php it will create                          file outside adminpanel folder ("../page1.php" or "../page1.txt" or "../page1.css" or any other file extension)<br><br>
              3)If you want to create a file in a specific folder then just use path as ("../folder1/page1.php" or "folder1/page1.php")
